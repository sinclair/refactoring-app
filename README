# Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code
#   - by Martin Fowler et al

This is the starting program from the Refactoring book.
The intention is to use this as the basis for working through the refactorings. The main difference is the implementation language, in this case Ruby.

The implementation is true to the original Java implementation. Some Ruby-isms (idioms) have been leveraged where appropriate without 'improving' on the original.
